    "\n",
    "#### **🧠 Why start here?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because **apps need data.** Whether it’s a user login, product list, or how many times someone clicked the “Buy” button — **everything gets stored somewhere**. AWS gives you two major types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RDS (Relational Database Service)** → For structured SQL data (users, orders, invoices)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DynamoDB** → For unstructured or fast NoSQL data (likes, logs, leaderboard, OTPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can’t build an app without storage, and using Excel sheets doesn’t scale. Trust me, we’ve all tried.\n",
